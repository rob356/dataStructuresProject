########################### MAIN GAME CONFIG ###############################

# PLAYER_MODULES ---
# List of player modules separated by commas.
# Names of player modules are the names of the subdirectories (packages)
# inside the StudentEngines directory.
# The number of modules listed here determines the number of players in the
# game. 
# To play via the GUI, use Human.  

PLAYER_MODULES OKComputer,Human

# PART ONE ---
# Enter part one mode if the player code is currently set up to perform
# the functionality specified in Part 1 of the project assignment.
# TIP: PLAYER_MODULES should _only_ contain the name of the player
# being tested.

PART_ONE True

# UI ---
# Should the graphical UI be displayed?

UI True

# AUTO_PLAY ---
# Enable/disable automatic gameplay
# True => automatic - Moves proceed based on the ANIMATION_SPEED variable.
# False => manual - Striking the ENTER key
#                   in the console advances to the next move.

AUTO_PLAY True

# ANIMATION_SPEED ---
# Animation speed, in milliseconds is the time between successive moves
# when AUTO_PLAY (above) is True. So, lower is faster.
# Acceptable values: 1-3000
# Any number below 300 disables the fancy movement animations.

ANIMATION_SPEED 500

# FILE_LOGGING ---
# Should the game log be saved in a file during game play?
# If True, the file's name is created automatically from the current date
# and time.
# The log files are found in the Logs directory.

FILE_LOGGING True

# STDOUT_LOGGING ---
# Should the game log be displayed in the console during game play?
# See code documentation for access to the logging variable.

STDOUT_LOGGING True

# PRE_MOVE ---
# Moves to make before the players get control
# This variable is unique in that it can be assigned many consecutive values.
# When a game starts, the moves are executed in the order that they appear
# in this file. They get executed after the players' and engine's init()
# functions are called. Each move performed causes calls to the same notifying
# functions that get called if a player had had its move() function called.
# Note that the programmer must take care to alternate the player ID of each
# successive PRE_MOVE to mimic what would happen in a normal game with the
# number of players specified in PLAYER_MODULES, above.
# The format is that of the PlayerMove constructor (found in 
# Model/interface.py).
# Below are listed four sample pre-moves for a 1-player game.
# Uncomment them to use them.

# PlayerMove(player ID, player movement, start row, start col, end row, end col)

# PRE_MOVE PlayerMove(1,False,7,3,7,5)
# PRE_MOVE PlayerMove(1,False,7,5,7,7)
# PRE_MOVE PlayerMove(1,False,7,6,9,6)
